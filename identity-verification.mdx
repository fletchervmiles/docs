# Identity Verification

Our identity verification system helps you verify your users' identities quickly and securely. This page covers everything you need to know about implementing identity verification in your application.

## Overview

Identity verification is a crucial part of building trust and compliance in your application. Our system provides:

- **Document Verification** - Verify government-issued IDs, passports, and other documents
- **Biometric Verification** - Use facial recognition to match users with their documents
- **Real-time Processing** - Get verification results in seconds
- **Global Coverage** - Support for documents from 200+ countries

## Getting Started

To start using identity verification:

1. **Configure your verification settings**
   - Choose which documents to accept
   - Set up your verification workflow
   - Configure callback URLs

2. **Initialize the verification process**
   - Create a verification session
   - Redirect users to the verification flow
   - Handle the verification results

## Basic Implementation

Here's how to initiate a verification process:

```javascript
// Create a verification session
const session = await createVerificationSession({
  user_id: 'user_123',
  callback_url: 'https://yourdomain.com/verification/callback',
  document_types: ['passport', 'drivers_license', 'national_id']
});

// Redirect user to verification URL
window.location.href = session.verification_url;
```

## Verification Flow

The typical verification flow includes:

1. **Document Capture** - User takes photos of their documents
2. **Selfie Capture** - User takes a selfie for biometric matching
3. **Processing** - Our system analyzes the documents and biometrics
4. **Results** - You receive the verification results via webhook or callback

## Handling Results

```javascript
// Handle verification callback
app.post('/verification/callback', (req, res) => {
  const { session_id, status, result } = req.body;
  
  if (status === 'completed') {
    // Verification successful
    console.log('Verification passed:', result);
    // Update user status in your system
  } else {
    // Verification failed
    console.log('Verification failed:', result.reason);
    // Handle failed verification
  }
});
```

## Best Practices

<Tip>
Always verify the authenticity of webhook calls by checking the signature to ensure they come from our servers.
</Tip>

- **Security**: Always validate webhook signatures
- **User Experience**: Provide clear instructions to users
- **Compliance**: Ensure you meet local regulations
- **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling for failed verifications

# Franko Identity Verification (Optional)

Give Franko the power to greet users by name and link conversations to real accounts.

## Why verify?

* Personalised greetings and smarter responses
* View conversations grouped by user in your dashboard
* Link feedback to customer records for analysis

## How it works

1. Generate a **verification secret** in the **Connect → Identity verification** card.
2. On your server, compute a SHA-256 HMAC of the `user_id` using the secret.
3. Expose the values to the browser with the `window.FrankoUser` snippet **before** the embed script.

Franko recreates the HMAC server-side. If it matches, the user is verified. If not, Franko discards the `user_id` but continues the conversation anonymously.

## Server-side example (Node.js)

```js
import crypto from "crypto";

const SECRET = process.env.FRANKO_VERIFICATION_SECRET; // keep this safe!
const userId = currentUser.id;                         // any unique string/UUID

const userHash = crypto.createHmac("sha256", SECRET)
                       .update(userId)
                       .digest("hex");
```

## Client snippet

```html
<script>
window.FrankoUser = {
  user_id: "USER_ID_FROM_SERVER",
  user_hash: "HASH_FROM_SERVER",
  user_metadata: {
    name: "Jane Doe",
    email: "jane@acme.com",
    company: "Acme Inc"
  }
}
</script>
```

Add this **before** the main embed snippet.

## Stored data & display logic

| Field | Stored? | Shown in dashboard | Notes |
|-------|---------|--------------------|-------|
| `user_id` | ✔️ | ✔️ (if hash valid) | Primary identifier |
| `user_hash` | ❌ | ❌ | Used only for verification |
| `user_metadata` | ✔️ | ✔️ | JSON blob for extra context |
| `name`, `email` (extracted) | ✔️ | ✔️ | Convenience columns |

## FAQ

**Do I have to verify users?**  
No. Skip the snippet if anonymity is fine.

**Can I regenerate the secret?**  
Yes – click **Regenerate** in the Connect tab. Update your server-side code accordingly.

**Is HTTPS required?**  
Yes. Never expose the secret over insecure HTTP.
