Every Franko modal is available as a standalone webpage that you can share anywhere with a unique link.

---

## How it works

Navigate to your modal, "Connect" tab and then find the "Direct Link" section. It will look something like this:

```
https://franko.ai/embed/YOUR_MODAL_SLUG
```

The modal opens in a new browser tab as a standalone page, no embedding required.
